# heartbeat-monitor
Project made during college to integrate heartbeat sensor to a web application capable of reading vital signals. Using vanilla javascript with highcharts.js on the interface, firebase on the database, hosting and authentication. 
On the hardware side, an ESP32 with wi-fi was used as a communication device between the pulse sensor and the interface. 

The main reason to develop this project was to better understand and validate a model of how different network layers behave on Internet of Things (IOT) applications and 
on common computer architetures. 

Above I put some diagrams and images of the project. If you are curious and need more information about it, feel free to contact me.
